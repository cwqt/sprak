Duolingo-like language learning tool for the CLI

* Anki deck sync
* Google TTS Waveshare voice
* [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)
* Modes mirroring Duo:
    - Multliple choice (for words, sentences)
    - Type sentence to / from target language
    - Listen & write from target to native
    - Word matching

Obviously a lot more to be considered like word synonyms / alternative structures but just to KISS will use LD to calculate correctness.
